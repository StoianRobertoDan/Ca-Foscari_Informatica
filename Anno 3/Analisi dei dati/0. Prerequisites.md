- **Sample space** $\Omega$: collection of all elementary results (outcomes of an experiment).
- **Event E**: set of outcomes, subset of the sample space. (Empty event : $\emptyset$)
- **Union of events** ($A\cup B\cup ...$): the event considering all the outcomes of all the events A,B,... . Key word: ***OR***.
- **Intersection** ($A\cap B\cap ...$): the event considering the outcomes common to all the events A,B,... . Key word: ***AND***.
- **Complement** ($\overline{A}$): the event that occurs when A does not occur. Key word: ***OR***.
	- The complement of a union is as follows: $\overline{A\cup B} = \overline{A}\cap\overline{B}$
		- This rule work for as many events as there are in the sample space.
	- The complement of an intersection is as follows: $\overline{A\cap B} = \overline{A}\cup\overline{B}$
		- This rule work for as many events as there are in the sample space.
- **Difference** ($A\backslash B$): the event considering the outcomes of event A that does not occur in event B. Key word: ***BUT NOT***.
- **Disjoint events**: 
	- Events are disjointed if their intersection is empty: $A\cap B = \emptyset$
	- Multiple events are mutually exclusive (or pairwise disjointed) if any two of these are disjointed: $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},...$ ; $A_{i}\cap A_{j} =\emptyset \; \forall \; i\neq j$
	- Mutually exclusive events will never occur at the same time.
- **Exhaustive events**:
	- Events are exhaustive when their union equals the whole sample space: $A\cup B\cup ...=\Omega$

**Probability**:
- Sigma-algebra:
	- A collection $\mathfrak{M}$ of events is a sigma-algebra on sample space $\Omega$ if:
		- It includes the sample space: $\Omega\in\mathfrak{M}$
		- Every event is contained along its components: $E\in\mathfrak{M}\Rightarrow\overline{E}\in\mathfrak{M}$
		- Every finite or countable collection of events is contained along with its union: $E_{1},E_{2},...\in\mathfrak{M}\Rightarrow E_{1}\cup E_{2}\cup...\in\mathfrak{M}$
- Axioms:
	- Assume a sample space $\Omega$ and a sigma-algebra $\mathfrak{M}$.
	- Probability: $\mathbf{P}:\mathfrak{M}\rightarrow[0,1]$ is a function of events with the domain $\mathfrak{M}$ and range $[0,1]$ that satisfies the following conditions:
		- **Unit measure**: the sample space has unit probability ($\mathbf{P}(\Omega)=1$)
		- **Sigma-additivity**: for any finite or countable collection of mutually exclusive events $E_{1},E_{2},...\in\mathfrak{M} \Rightarrow$ $$\mathbf{P}\{E_{1}\cup E_{2}\cup...\}=\mathbf{P}(E_{1})+\mathbf{P}(E_{2})+...$$
- Computing probabilities of events:
	- Extreme cases:
		- A sample space $\Omega$ consists of all possible outcomes, therefore it occurs for sure: $\mathbf{P}(\Omega) = 1$
		- The empty space $\emptyset$ never occurs, therefore  $\mathbf{P}(\emptyset) = 0$
	- Union:
